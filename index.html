              It’s been a challenging week on the coding front. (Let’s face it, there is no easy week in engineering). My brother is taking part in the annual Chase the Sun cycling challenge in June, in which he will set off at sunrise and attempt to get from the east side of England to the west on his bike before the sun sets at the end of the day. And guess who’s been roped into being his support team? That’s right, ol’ muggins over here!
              <br>
              <br>
              To make his and quite frankly my life easier on the day. I have been working on building an interface that will do all the calculations to observe if he is making good time, can afford to take an extra break or two and generally make sure he is on track to successfully finish. As a result, I am having my first bash at independently integrating an API into the interface. Taking his distance, time and speed from his Wahoo Fitness account and applying necessary formulas to analyze his progress.
              <br>
              <br>
              This biggest challenge I am facing is that Wahoo fitness only allow their API to interact using Python. A language I have no prior experience using…ah well, what’s life without a challenge!
              <br>
              <br>
              I have included the current progress in my projects below and I have to say I am quite proud of its simplicity and efficiency so far. Least of all the little cycling dude in the right of the screen who moves in real time between sunrise and sunset. Starting on the left at sunrise and eventually finding himself towards the finish line at the end of that day.

              The journey of finding employment can be an arduous and emotionally taxing process. It is a realm of life where hopes, dreams, and aspirations collide with uncertainty, rejection, and self-doubt. This past week, I found myself submerged in the depths of these pressures, battling against the psychological toll it took on my well-being. In this blog post, I would like to reflect on my recent experiences, sharing the challenges faced and the lessons learned along the way.
              <br>
              <br>
              Eight weeks on from completing my bootcamp I have to say the job hunt has become quite exhausting, writing cover letter after cover letter, and searching for appropriate roles. And thank god for personal information autofill! Having spoken to a few of my cohort who are also still searching for their first role, it’s clear that times are tough right now for junior developers. It is a huge psychological battle trying to remain motivated and retain a positive mindset. My excel spreadsheet tells me I have been turned down from 33% of my applications and much of the rest just haven’t responded.
              <br>
              <br>
              Job hunting can be a solitary endeavour, often leaving us feeling isolated and disconnected from the world around us. As friends and acquaintances celebrate their own successes (my girlfriend finishes the 2nd year of her PHD this week!!), it's easy to fall into a comparison trap and question our own progress.
              <br>
              <br>
              One of the most difficult aspects of job hunting is dealing with rejection. A single rejection can feel like a personal blow, chipping away at our confidence and leaving us questioning our abilities. It is crucial to recognize that rejection is not a reflection of our self-worth, but rather a mismatch between our skills and the specific requirements of the role. This isn’t necessarily something that bothers me all that much, more the uncertainty of where; or perhaps more importantly WHEN the next opportunity will present itself.
              <br>
              <br>
              Amidst the pressures of job hunting, it is easy to neglect our own well-being. Long hours spent searching, writing applications, and wondering if I should be doing more can take a toll on the old mental health. It is crucial to prioritize self-care, maintaining a healthy work-life balance, and engaging in activities that rejuvenate us. Thankfully the weather has taken a turn and the sunshine offers an opportunity to embrace the great outdoors, step away from the pressures of trying to land a job and get those steps in.
              <br>
              <br>
              Reflecting on this difficult week, I have come to realize that the job search process is not just about securing a position but also about personal growth and self-discovery. Each rejection and setback offers an opportunity for reflection and improvement. Good things come to those who wait...
